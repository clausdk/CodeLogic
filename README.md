The Codelogic.Core framework is a C# .NET 6 library that provides a set of tools and utilities for developing .NET applications. It includes several core features that can be used by other libraries and applications, including:

A logging system that can be used to log messages to multiple destinations, such as the console or a file.
A configuration system that can be used to manage application configuration data using JSON files.
Common utility functions for working with strings, encryption, and other common tasks.
In addition to these core features, the Codelogic.Core library also includes an extension system that allows developers to add additional functionality to their applications. The extension system is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to define their own extensions and add them to their applications as needed.

Each extension is implemented as a separate .NET assembly that can be loaded dynamically at runtime. Extensions can define their own configuration data and logging providers, which are integrated with the Codelogic.Core logging and configuration systems.

To use the Codelogic.Core library in an application, developers simply need to include a reference to the library in their project and start using the provided functionality. They can also create their own extensions and add them to their application by including the extension assemblies in the application's extensions folder. The Codelogic.Core library will automatically detect and load the extensions at runtime.

Overall, the Codelogic.Core library provides a flexible, extensible framework for developing .NET applications with logging, configuration, and other utility functionality. It is designed to be easy to use and customize, making it a valuable tool for developers of all levels of experience.
